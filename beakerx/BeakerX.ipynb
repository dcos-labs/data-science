    "# How to Build an Interactive Spark Notebook with BeakerX and Jupyter on DC/OS\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)—one of the industry’s favorite open-source web applications for creating and sharing documents housing live code, equations, visualizations, and more—are great for iterative data science work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, working with large datasets can be challenging since data doesn’t typically fit on the local disk or into local memory. Instead, data is stored in a cluster and a distributed computing framework such as [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is required to process it within a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is where BeakerX comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "[BeakerX](http://beakerx.com/) is a collection of Jupyter kernels and notebook extensions that allows you to work efficiently with large Spark datasets directly from a notebook. In addition, you can still use the data science libraries you're familiar with for local development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use BeakerX to build an interactive notebook that reads a dataset from [HDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html) and classifies the data using a linear model built with Spark in Scala. We’ll also produce a report using popular Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, it’s important to note that this tutorial assumes you're using [Jupyter Notebooks on DC/OS](https://d2iq.com/service-catalog/beta-mesosphere-jupyter-service), which offers notebooks preconfigured with many popular data science tools such as Spark, BeakerX, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)."
